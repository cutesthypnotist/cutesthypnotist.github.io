I'm Pema. I write code - sometimes. I'm particularly interested in graphics,
virtual reality, programming language development, functional programming and
pure mathematics.
Check out [my stuff](https://github.com/pema99), if you want, and feel free to reach
out on any socials.

I'm trying to eventually turn this website into a [blog](archive.md).
More content to come in the future.
